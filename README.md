## Development

You can use docker-compose to run a local copy of the application. Here are useful Make commands:
* `make vendor` downloads all required modules, tidy up and verify them.
* `make build` builds Docker image locally.
* `make run` spins up local Docker containers so you can access via web or command line.
* `make test` runs all tests locally.
* `make rsh` spins up a temporary container based on the built image and gives you a bash inside that container.
* `make debug` spins up a temporary container based on the build image with sleep entrypoint, and gives you a bash inside that container to debug in case container stops immediately.
